## Opis

Formal verification is often associated with large, safety critical systems, tremendous amount of paper work, and complex math formulas. Goal of this presentation is to show that this is not just an unpleasant requirement but can be an ordinary tool which will save us plenty of time on testing, bug-fixing and will reduce the amount of the product escape. It is a providence that watches over us and thinks many steps ahead
