## Opis

The talk will describe an open source NVMe development platform developed by Western Digital and Antmicro for server-based AI applications. The system combines an FPGA SoC with programmable logic and an AMP CPU, running Zephyr on the Corex-R cores handling NVMe transactions and Linux on Cortex-A in an openAMP setup.

The platform includes an example showcasing a TensorFlow AI pipeline executed via the uBPF framework accelerating the AI model inference on an accelerator implemented in FPGA using TVM/VTA.
